How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It told me where did I made a typo error so i could correct it, at exact line.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would help me by viewing the chnages i did compared to last time, i worked upon the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

pros:
we can be judgemental about taking decions when to comit.

COns:
We may miss out, by commiting a chnage to small or too big, to be done all at once.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because mutiple files could be related to each other, chnage in each file need to be commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files

git log is to find a praticular commit.
git diff is to compare the commit we found out with the previous one.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something ?

changes can be rolled back n further easly even if a bug is introduced in the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

create repository, performing commits, performing checkouts.
